    "a.) For waves of water reflecting off a bridge (immovable barrier) the algebraic reflection coefficient is probably in phase (the same sign) as the incoming wave.  The vertical displacement of the incoming wave would sort of act like a generator for reflected waves with the same amplitude direction, at the same frequency, and propagating with the same speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.) **Need to think through more thoroughly** If waves are incident at right angle to the barrier, (e.g. North at 5 m/s w/r/t bridge oriented East/West).  Right at the bridge the waves would add constructively, (making big splashes), but the reflected waves would have a tendancy to maybe cause some sort of standing wave pattern spatially.  The reflected waves will have the same frequency, and the same speed and wavelength.  Can do this a little more mathematically.  Take North to be in $-\\hat{x}$ direction and wall to be apoint where $x=0$, at $t=0$ let the wavefront be a maximum.  (So we're considering wavefronts in the positive $x$ half plane).  If the wave is reflected with coefficient $B$ s.t. $B \\lt A$, then the total wave will be approximately.\n",

    "\n",
    "c.) There could be nodes in a standing wave pattern, but only if all of the energy is perfectly reflected at the wall, and little (none really) of the energy is dissipated during propagation, then a standing wave pattern would have nodes at quarter wavelengths (lines with $x \\approx n 1.25m; n \\in (1, 3, 5..)$.\n",
    "\n",

($\\tilde{V} = \\tilde{I} \\tilde{Z}$).  (Also, the boundary conditions across a conductor will require that the fields not have a parallel component)\n",

    "f.) An intuitive argument for this, (from class), is that if $I = \\frac{V}{Z}$ requires that $I = 0$.  From class $\\frac{I_0^{-}}{I_0^{+}} = - \\Gamma$ and therefore $\\tilde{I_L} = I_0^{+} - \\Gamma I_0^{+} = 0$ which gives us intuition for why in this case the reflection coefficient should be 1."
